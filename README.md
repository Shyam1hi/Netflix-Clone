# Netflix India Clone

This project is a clone of the Netflix India website, showcasing the design and functionality of the original site. The clone includes several sections, each representing key features of the Netflix platform.

## Code Overview

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an overview of the main components:

### HTML Structure

- **Navigation Bar:** The top navigation bar includes the Netflix logo, language selector, and a sign-in button.

- **Hero Section:** The hero section features a background image, overlay, and details about the Netflix subscription, including an email input for user sign-up.

- **Feature Sections:** Multiple sections highlight different features of Netflix, such as watching on various devices, downloading for offline viewing, and creating kids' profiles.

- **FAQ Section:** A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section with collapsible items that reveal answers when clicked.

- **Footer:** The footer includes various links, a language selector, and Netflix branding.

### CSS Styling

- **Global Styling:** The `*` selector is used to reset margins and paddings, and the `box-sizing` property is set to `border-box`.

- **Navigation Styling:** The navigation bar is styled with a dark background, and items are aligned with flexbox. Dropdowns and buttons have consistent styling.

- **Hero Styling:** The hero section has an overlay for better text visibility. Email input and button styling is consistent throughout the project.

- **Card Styling:** Different cards showcasing features are styled with flexbox and positioned appropriately on the page.

- **FAQ Styling:** The FAQ section has a clean and responsive design. Collapsible items have transition effects.

### JavaScript Interaction

- **FAQ Interaction:** JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the FAQ section. Clicking on a question toggles the visibility of the corresponding answer.

## How It Works

The clone replicates the visual and interactive aspects of the Netflix India website. Users can navigate through different sections, explore features, and read FAQs. The project is a static representation and does not include server-side functionality.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to understand the implementation details and customize it according to your needs.
